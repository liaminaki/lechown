# 🐖 Lechown: The Cebuano Chase

Lechown: The Cebuano Chase is a fast-paced, multiplayer LAN game that plunges players into a vibrant world inspired by the rich culture of Cebu and its iconic lechon tradition. Inspired by the minimalist yet dynamic style of classic arcade games like Tron, this game puts players in the roles of a baboy (pig) and its determined pursuer, the tao (a man). Set in a glowing, grid-like arena, the game challenges players to outmaneuver their opponent while navigating trails and avoiding collisions.
